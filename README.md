VShare is a file sharing application, through which you can send/receive a file between two machines.
->This application can send one file at a time to a single reciever only.
->Max size of file which can be sent is 4GB(Tested), so you can also send movies and all.
->Almost all file types supported(zip files not tested).
->File name and size is sent by the Sender class.(So you don't to type filename everytime at receiver side)
->Receiver checks if an incoming file already exixts in workspace, if yes then it changes the incoming filename.(Same as windows does when we copy paste same file multiple times)

Configuration:
->Setup the workspace path in Receiver.java
->Set the port number in Sender.java and Reciever.java as per your choice.

*Code contains printf statements for each step, they will help you understand the flow*
